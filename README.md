### 🧠 Lógica Principal

The spaceship rotates with the arrow keys and moves in the current facing direction.

Bullets are fired in the ship's current direction.

Large asteroids break into two medium ones when destroyed.

Medium asteroids break into two small ones.

Collisions use pixel-perfect masking.

Scores are automatically saved to a SQLite database.
